Using a Udemy course to code a fully functional webshop in PHP using Mysqli.
Addendum:
* Added a category overview in the category pages and product page
* Improved responsiveness with category section
* Changed colorscheme in style.css
* added the category menu in preview and category pages
* Add a breadcrumb navigation on products, category and preview pages
* improved rounded prices in cart and header
todo:
* change db connection to use PDO in stead of Mysqli
* product page Head section (total amount of products found in db)
* product page Latest product (maybe each category with a pic?)
